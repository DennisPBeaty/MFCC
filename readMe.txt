HW 2 Instructions

1. For question 1, to extract the key strokes from the audio segements, I used a program known as Audacity. I manually selected the segements of each key stroke and exported
   to their own individual .wav file that is located in a folder names "KEYNAME_logs". 
   
2. For question 2, I developed a python program named mfcc.py that upon running will fill in the outputs folder's individual folders for the MFCC data. Within each folder, you
   will find an png image that corresponds numerically with the same numbered file in the KEYNAME_logs folder mentioned in question 1.
